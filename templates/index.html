                place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">We know that you're fed up with the obsolete and outdated methods of teaching and you want something pragmatic. Tech Education is impossible without pragmatism and same is our approach. Whatever we teach, we do that practically. So, there's no need to be afraid of coding and all that stuff. We stress upon project based learning, for once you learn how to implement anything in a real world project, you automatically get to know about everything about that thing. <br> <br> So, Come here and enjoy the technology.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and
                skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.
